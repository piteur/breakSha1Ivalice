Break sha1 with salt encoding
================

It's a quick C script to break Ivalice server sha1 hash


This script allow to make multi-thread process to break the sha1 with salt encryption used in the time by Ivalice.
This script also allow to stop & restart the process without loosing data.

It's very ugly, but it worked very well before :)
